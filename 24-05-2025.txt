  Scalability
  Security
  Data Redundancy
  Compliance
  Cost Efficiency
Key Considerations When Choosing a Data Center:
  Location
  Security
  Network Connectivity
  Redundancy and Backup
  Energy Efficiency
Azure Regional Pairs:
  Azure Regional Pairs refer to the pairing of two Azure data centers located within the same geographic region or area, usually within 300 miles of each other. Each Azure region is paired with another for the purpose of providing high availability, disaster recovery, and data residency.
  Pairing ensures that if one data center or region faces an outage, the services in the other paired region can continue to operate with minimal disruption.
Key Features of Azure Regional Pairs:
    High Availability
    Disaster Recovery
    Data Residency and Compliance
    Synchronous Data Replication
    Automatic Failover
    Service Boundaries
Examples of Azure Regional Pairs:  East US & West US, North Europe & West Europe, and Central India & South India.
Benefits of Azure Regional Pairs:
    Reliability: Redundancy through distribution of workloads between physically separate locations.
    Business Continuity: Enables service failover during unplanned disruptions.
    Cost Efficiency: Disaster recovery can be optimized without separate infrastructure investments.
    Reduced Latency: Paired regions within 300 miles offer low-latency data transfer.
    Compliance & Residency: Helps meet legal/regulatory standards for data storage.
Choosing a Regional Pair:
    Compliance Requirements: Ensure data storage meets regulatory requirements in specific regions.
    Proximity to End-Users: Choose a region closer to your target audience to reduce latency.
    Cost Implications: Balance costs associated with inter-region data transfer and redundancy.

Edge Locations in Azure?
In Azure, Edge Locations are physical data centers in Azure's Content Delivery Network (CDN). They are strategically placed across various geographical regions to improve performance by caching and delivering content closer to users.
Purpose of Edge Locations:
Edge locations optimize the delivery of content, reduce latency, and improve the overall user experience by caching static content like images, videos, and other web assets.
Role in Azure CDN:
Edge locations serve as key components of Azure's CDN, allowing for content caching and quick retrieval from the nearest location to the end user, enhancing performance for global applications.
Benefits of Edge Locations:
    Low Latency: Content is delivered from the nearest edge location, reducing load times.
    High Availability: Edge locations help improve content availability by distributing it globally.
    Cost Efficiency: Reduces the load on origin servers and reduces bandwidth costs.
Use Cases for Edge Locations:
    Video Streaming: Distributing high-quality video content with minimal buffering.
    Web Acceleration: Speeding up the delivery of websites and applications to users globally.
    Global Content Delivery: Serving static files and assets to users around the world without overloading the central server.
Key Features of Edge Locations:
    Caching: Temporary storage of frequently accessed content for faster retrieval.
    Intelligent Routing: Azure Traffic Manager and Azure Front Door route requests to the nearest edge location based on user proximity.
    Security: Protection through features like DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF) at edge locations.
